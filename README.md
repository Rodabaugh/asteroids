# Boot.dev Asteroids  Project

I'm creating this project as a part of the Boot.Dev backend developer course.

# To Play the Game
Ensure you have Python 3 installed.
Download the zip file for the repo.
Run pip install -r requirements.txt
Start the game with "python3 main.py"
Use WASD and Space to play. Your score will be displayed in the terminal when you crash.
